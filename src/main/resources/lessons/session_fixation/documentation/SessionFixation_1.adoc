==== Introduction

Session fixation is a security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker forces a user's session identifier (usually stored in a cookie) to be set to a value chosen by the attacker.
This attack can result in the attacker being able to impersonate the victim's session and gain unauthorized access to their account.

==== How session fixation works

The following steps outline the process of a session fixation attack:

- The attacker obtains a session identifier (SID) from a valid session, either by generating one or through some other means.

- The attacker tricks the victim into clicking on a malicious link that includes the obtained SID.
This link might be sent via email, social engineering, or another method.

- When the victim clicks the malicious link, their browser uses the provided SID to identify the session.
The attacker can then use the same SID to access the victim's session after they log in.

- The attacker now has unauthorized access to the victim's account, effectively taking over their session.


====  Implications and risks

A successful session fixation attack can have serious consequences, including:

- Unauthorized access to the victim's account and sensitive information.
- Ability to perform actions on behalf of the victim.
- Compromise of confidential data.
- Damage to the victim's reputation and trust in the web application.
