==== Preventing session fixation attacks

Most modern web frameworks do a pretty decent job fixing the problem automatically.
Please read up on your framework before.

To defend against session fixation attacks, web developers can implement the following countermeasures:

- Never trust an url parameter: Never pass session identifiers via URLs, as these can be easily manipulated.
- Session regeneration: always change the session identifier upon significant events, such as login or privilege level change.
- Session timeout: Implement a session timeout mechanism that automatically logs out inactive users after a specified period.
This will help when an attacker sends an email to a victim with a link.
This way the link containing the session-id is already timed out.
- Random session identifiers: Generate session identifiers using a strong random number generator to make them difficult to guess or predict.
- Cookie attributes: Set `secure` and `HttpOnly` attributes for cookies to prevent manipulation and unauthorized access.
