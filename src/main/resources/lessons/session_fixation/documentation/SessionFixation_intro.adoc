In this lesson, you will learn about a common web application vulnerability called "Session Fixation." Session fixation is an attack that allows an attacker to set a victim's session identifier, potentially giving them unauthorized access to the victim's account.
We will explore how this attack works, its implications, and how to defend against it.

Goals:

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Explain what a session fixation attack is and how it works.
- Understand the potential risks and consequences of a successful session fixation attack.
- Implement countermeasures to defend against session fixation attacks in a web application.
